<p>The “WHY” for writing this article is “Can an idea be molded into code when provided with proper tools and inspiration . This drove me to write simple python code and this article as well</p>
<p>As title suggest our main goal is to extract and transfer data from database to text file using python as a tool .There are lot of tools and methods that help us in achieving the above goal. This tutorial is the stepping stone to achieve it , providing you the insight and idea what happens at micro level and help you build things based on the this.</p>

<ul>
<li>Tools used in this tutorial
<ul>
<li>Python ,</li>
<li>SQL</li>
<li>SQLite3 database</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Reason to choose Python is that it is very easy for beginner and intermediate programmer to understand each and every line of code written unlike any other complicated languages like C or Java , Python has its on advantages there are lot of tutorials , documents you can go through draw your own opinion and other reason to choose I started learning it no other major reasons. I choose SQLite because it comes as a built in module in Python , its open source and here the official document . Every database has its own pros and cons since our project is a very simple one I choose SQLite. Editor to write the code is your choice , there are lot of editors available with their set of advantages and disadvantages. Feel free to use anything.</p>
<p>I expect my readers have basic knowledge on any Python and SQL language .
How to achieve our goal , with proper tools. If you have forgotten our aim is to transfer data from Database in our case it is SQLite to text format with the help of Python programming language.</p>
<p>Code starts with importing sqlite3 module and establishing a connection object that represents our database . This connection object differs from DB to DB. We are naming our database as “testDB.sqlite”</p>
<pre><code>import sqlite3
</code></pre>
<p>A simple function to take care of all our connections is written below which takes database name as parameter.</p>
<pre><code>def sql_connection(dbname):	        
    #DATABASE_LOCATION = &quot;sqlite:///testDb.sqlite&quot;    
    #engine = sqlalchemy.create_engine(DATABASE_LOCATION)    
    try:    
        conn = sqlite3.connect(dbname)    
    except sqlite3.Error:    
        print(f&quot;Error conncting db..'{dbname}'&quot;)    
    finally:    
        return conn
</code></pre>
<p>We connect to database and once it is done we need to a tool to execute sql command , for the same we create a cursor object . Cursor allows code to execute SQL queries , we will see that in a bit.</p>
<pre><code>conn = sql_connection(&quot;testDb.sqlite&quot;)
cursor = conn.cursor()
</code></pre>
<p>Once connection and cursor are established then we can move forward to transfer our data .</p>
<p>Please bear in mind that I have already inserted data in to the tables of my database . This can be achieved by below code</p>
<h3 id="creating-table-in-database">Creating table in Database</h3>
<pre><code>create_table = &quot;&quot;&quot;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS my_songs(
song_id varchar(100),
song_name varchar(100),
artist_name varchar(100),
time varchar(100),
CONSTRAINT primary_key_constraint PRIMARY KEY (song_id)
)
&quot;&quot;&quot;
cursor.execute(create_table)
</code></pre>
<p>Similarly inserting data is also achieved</p>
<h3 id="inserting-data-to-table-in-the-database">Inserting data to Table in the database</h3>
<pre><code>cursor.execute('''INSERT INTO my_songs VALUES (&quot;54&quot; &quot;Daddy Cool&quot; &quot;Boney M.&quot; &quot;2021-11-08&quot;)''')
</code></pre>
<h3 id="committing-changes-in-the-database">Committing changes in the database</h3>
<pre><code>conn.commit()
</code></pre>
<h3 id="for-closing-the-connection">For Closing the connection</h3>
<pre><code>conn.close()
</code></pre>
<p>In order to view the sqlite3 data there are many online as well as offline tools to view the data for example “DB browser for Sqlite” or you can install sqlite3 .</p>
<p>Fetching all the data using cursor.fetch_all() command which gets its data from the cursor that pull the data from SELECT command .</p>
<pre><code>cursor.execute(&quot;SELECT * FROM my_spotify_songs &quot;)
results = cursor.fetchall()
</code></pre>
<p>Next phase is extracting the data and send it to a file format , for this we have written a function write_to_file() which takes in file name as an aargument</p>
<pre><code>def write_to_file(filename):
	string = ' '
	for result in results:
        string = ' '.join(result)
        with open(filename,'a') as fp:
        fp.write((string +&quot;\n&quot;))
        print(f&quot;Data inserted to {filename}&quot;)
write_to_file('test.txt')
</code></pre>
<p>calling the function write_to_file(‘test.txt’) with file name.</p>
<p>Important thing to bear in mind is that , results argument here always return Tuple . Tuple is one of the data structures in Python similar to that of List , tuple are immutable . Function is converting Tuple to string and writing to file . We are using appending the date to file with ‘a’ .</p>
<p>Here is the out of the text file .</p>
<p>Data inserted to test.txt</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The above code is a example of how your simple idea can be molded in to code form and may be from here you might get some inspiration to another great idea .</p>
